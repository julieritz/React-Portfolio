## About Me
Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

My marketing background and expertise (and, frankly, creative side) have allowed me to go beyond just the technical aspect of websites. I love writing, designing and coding... so I plan to do all three!

My portfolio doesn't just focus on the cool websites and applications I've built. You can also read blogs and copy I've written, check out some designs I've made through photoshop and see all the skills that make me unqiue.

I can't wait to create more thoughful, customer-centric designs.

Created using:
- React
- UIKit
- JavaScript
