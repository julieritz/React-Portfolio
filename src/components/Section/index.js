                            Thanks for getting to know more about me and what I do. Although I'm Seattle based, I'm a Boston native who will let you know how much
                            better the bagels and pizza are on the east coast within 5 minutes of meeting me. While I'm a marketer  and coder by
                            day, I also enjoy baking/cooking, hiking and traveling. I've lived all over the world including in
                            South Korea and Spain and plan to make it to Antarctica as soon as I can.
                        <br /><br />
                            I'm in a unique position with my background as a marketer and coder 
                            because I can't just technically build beautiful websites, 
                            but I can deisgn creative, write copy and create the entire user experience from start to finish.
                            Need help writing or launching a blog? I've got you. Looking for a refresh of your creative materials? Sign me up. Need help with your analytics or lead generation? I'm just as tactical as I am artistic.
                        <br /><br />    
                            I'm happy to work with you in any capacity of my skills.
                            I can't wait to build customer-centric websites that are as beautiful as they are useful, and I look forward to what we can do together.
